# cal.com_test

This repository includes automated tests for the Scheduling application hosted at http://localhost:3000. The tests validate the core functionalities, such as adding, removing, and retrieving events, while also covering scenarios for IP-based testing. Additionally, we use ngrok to expose the local server, enabling seamless test execution in GitHub workflows.
